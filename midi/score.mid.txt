About this sheet music

This new edition of Bach's Goldberg Variations is created by MuseScore lead developer Werner Schweer. The funds to create this work raised via the crowd funding site Kickstarter (http://kck.st/opengoldberg). The edition has been refined through an open process of peer review and careful scrutiny from pianist Kimiko Ishizaka. You can listen and download her recording on http://opengoldbergvariations.org
