Desire of the heart but denial of the eyes, it’s your endless coyness.
Handsome turns back; for whom, in vein, you adorn yourself.
Vocal words missing, heart churning in silent flames.
Hard grin on your lips, O lady, your heart twitches in pain.
The garland stings, thorny bed hurts a lot –            
Shore of the ocean of love is marred with everlasting partition.
- Translated by Anjan Ganguly
