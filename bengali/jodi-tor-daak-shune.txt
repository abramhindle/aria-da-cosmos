IF THEY ANSWER not to thy call walk alone,
If they are afraid and cower mutely facing the wall,
O thou of evil luck,
Open thy mind and speak out alone.
If they turn away, and desert you when crossing the wilderness,
O thou of evil luck,
Trample the thorns under thy tread,
And along the blood-lined track travel alone.
If they do not hold up the light
When the night is troubled with storm,
O thou of evil luck,
With the thunder flame of pain ignite thine own heart
And let it burn alone.
- Translated by Rabindranath Tagore

If no one responds to your call, move alone.
O dear, move alone.
If no one speaks, O the ill-fated,
If everyone looks the other way, afraid – 
You speak out alone, loud enough, open-hearted.
If everyone shows his back, O the ill-fated,
If no one looks back while traversing deep woods.
You deal alone the roughness of roads under your blood-soaked feet.
If nowhere is light seen, O the ill-fated,
If every door is closed in the dark and stormy night.
You burn alone; ignite your ribs from the flash of lightning.
- Translated by Anjan Ganguly

If nobody listens to your call 
Then go it alone, go it alone! 
Oh hey tragic traveller! 
If nobody talks to you, 
If everybody turns away from you 
If everybody is afraid (of the truth) 
Then open up your heart,
Speak alone (about) what’s in your mind,  
Oh, hey tragic traveller!
If everybody turns away 
If nobody notices you -
While traversing the hard path
Then alone you tread under your bloodied feet 
All those spikes on the road.
Oh, hey tragic traveller!
If there is no light in sight 
If the doors are shut by the dark & stormy night 
Then let the claps of thunder set your heart ablaze
And let it burn - alone.
- Translated by Rabiul Zaki
