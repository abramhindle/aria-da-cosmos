I would like to utter those words once again to you 
The words that I have articulated more than a few times â€“
The lyrics that echo within my core
Amid relentless downpour.
Ask me not the reason; neither I have the meaning,
Melodies churn out of cluttered anguish.
Libretto that sporadically stir up my mind in dreams
I wish to whisper that
Under the sky overcast and dour.
